# predicting-customer-categories

For this project we will be using customer dataset related to a telecommunication company, we will be using classification algorthms such as KNN(K Nearest Neighbor) to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

# Project goals
Develop code for cleaning and prepare data for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain deeper understanding of variables
- develop data visualization to discuss findings
- Model deployment to predict customer's categories
- evaluate the accuracy of model

# python Libraries used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- sklearn
